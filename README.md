# sandbox-ga4-for-amp
This is a sandbox for implementing GA4 settings for AMP sites.
GitHub Pages is used to distribute json files for GA4 for AMP.
This is for my personal validation and I cannot guarantee that it will work with this resource.

## Usage

Path of the JSON file being delivered.

https://shinshin86.github.io/sandbox-ga4-for-amp/ga4.json

Used in the amp-analytics tag.

```html
<!-- TODO -->
```

## Goals of this project

The goal is to allow AMP sites to complete the GA4 setup by simply setting the GA4 measurement ID.

Currently, GA4 does not support AMP. Therefore, the goal is to solve this problem as an alternative.


## Special Thanks
I have relied heavily on the information contained in this repository in conducting this work.

I am initially checking the behavior by forking the JSON file provided here and gradually working to get closer to the desired behavior.
